{% include profile-short.html name="Dr Eirik Valseth" extra="co-PI" position="Research Associate, at the Oden Institute, University of Texas at Austin" position2=" Associate Professor of Scientific Computing,  Department of Data Science, Norwegian University of Life Science, Norway"  bio="Dr Valserth is an Associate Professor of Scientific Computing at the Norwegian University of Life Science (NMBU) Department of Data Science as well as a research associate at the  Oden Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, and an affiliated researcher at Simula Research Laboratory Department of Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing. Prior to joining NMBU and Simula, Dr Valserth was also a postdoc funded by an individual Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions project working with Kent-Andre Mardal. He attended the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology where he earned his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering supervised by Albert Romkes. His work is in the development of finite element methods for PDEs where classical finite element methods typically fail to produce acceptable approximations. Currently, his focus is within the context of flood modeling (e.g., hurricane storm surge and riverine flooding) as well as modeling for hydropower applications." link="/assets/team_profile/Eirik.png"%}
