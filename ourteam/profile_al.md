{% include profile-short.html name="Dr Albert Cerrone" extra="" position="Research Assistant Professor, The Oden Institute, University of Texas" position2="Research Assistant Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, University of Notre Dame"  bio="Albert received his PhD in 2014 from Cornell University, working under Tony Ingraffea in the Cornell Fracture Group.  There, he was engaged in multiscale modeling, specifically predicting microcrack nucleation in superalloys.  After Cornell, he joined the Lifing Technologies Laboratory at GE Research under Doug DeCesare where he investigated the durability of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) and developed new technologies for Digital Twin including cumulative damage models.

In late 2018, Albert joined the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering & Earth Sciences at the University of Notre Dame as a Melchor Visiting Assistant Professor.  He taught several semesters of Engineering Programming, Statics, and Solid Mechanics  Moreover, he conducted research in additive manufacturing (viz. Durability) and biofilm viability.  In May 2022, he joined the Computational Hydraulics Laboratory at Notre Dame as a Research Assistant Professor and the Oden Institute as a Senior Research Fellow.  He applies his industry and academic experience with Digital Twin to accelerate its maturation in the coastal hydraulics space." link="/assets/team_profile/Al.png"%}
